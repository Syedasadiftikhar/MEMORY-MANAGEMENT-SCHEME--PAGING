### Memory Management - Paging Implementation

This repository contains C programs demonstrating the implementation of memory management using the paging technique. The project includes the following tasks:

1. **Basic Paging Scheme**: Input number of pages, page size, frames, and logical addresses, then calculate physical addresses using a page table.
2. **Advanced Paging System**: Handle multiple logical addresses with validation and error handling for invalid inputs.
3. **Paging Simulation**: Simulate paging with random page-to-frame mappings, frame queries, and logical-to-physical address translation.

Each task is supported with sample inputs and outputs for clarity. Explore the code to learn and practice memory management concepts!
